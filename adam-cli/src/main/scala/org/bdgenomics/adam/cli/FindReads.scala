/**
 * FindReads is an auxiliary command to CompareADAM -- whereas CompareADAM takes two ADAM files (which
 * presumably contain the same reads, processed differently), joins them based on read-name, and computes
 * aggregates of one or more metrics (BucketComparisons) across those joined reads -- FindReads performs
 * the same join-and-metric-computation, but takes a second argument as well: a boolean condition on the
 * value(s) of the metric(s) computed.  FindReads then outputs just the names of the reads whose metric
 * values(s) meet the given condition.
 *
 * So, for example, CompareADAM might be used to find out that the same reads processed through two different
 * pipelines are aligned to different locations 3% of the time.
 *
 * FindReads would then allow you to output the names of those 3% of the reads which are aligned differently,
 * using a filter expression like "positions!=0".

   *
   * The boolean condition is specified by an operator { !=, =, <, > } and a value (which is
   * an integer, floating point number, pair specified by the '(value,value)' notation, or boolean).
   *
   * For example, "positions!=0" would specify those reads whose corresponding distance between files
   * was non-zero.
