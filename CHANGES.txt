ADAM Changelog

Trunk (not yet released)

  NEW FEATURES

  * Added ability to load and merge multiple ADAM files into a single RDD.

  * Pairwise, quantitative ADAM file comparisons: the CompareAdam command has been extended to calculate
    metrics on pairs of ADAM files which contain the same reads processed in two different ways (e.g.
    two different implementations of a pre-processing pipeline).  This can be used to compare different
    pipelines based on their read-by-read concordance across a number of fields: position, alignment,
    mapping and base quality scores, and can be extended to support new metrics or aggregations.
