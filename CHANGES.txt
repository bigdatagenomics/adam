ADAM Changelog

Trunk (not yet released)

  NEW FEATURES

  * Added ability to load and merge multiple ADAM files into a single RDD.

  * Pairwise, quantitative ADAM file comparisons: the CompareAdam command has been extended to calculate
    metrics on pairs of ADAM files which contain the same reads processed in two different ways (e.g.
    two different implementations of a pre-processing pipeline).  This can be used to compare different
    pipelines based on their read-by-read concordance across a number of fields: position, alignment,
    mapping and base quality scores, and can be extended to support new metrics or aggregations.

  * Added FASTA import, and RDD convenience functions for remapping contig IDs. This allows for reference
    sequences to be imported into an efficient record where bases are stored as a list of enums. Additionally,
    convenience values are calculated. This feature was introduced in PR #79.

  * Added helper functions for properly generating VCF headers for VCF export. This streamlines the process
    of converting ADAM Variant Calls to the legacy VCF format. This was added in PR#85.

  OPTIMIZATIONS

  IMPROVEMENTS

  BUG FIXES

  * Fixed issues where VCF header was not being written correctly. This prevented variant calls from being
    written after conversion. This was fixed in PR#85.
