Building Downstream Applications
================================

ADAM is packaged so that it can be used interactively via the ADAM
shell, called from the command line interface (CLI), or included as a
library when building downstream applications.

This document covers three patterns for building applications downstream
of ADAM:

-  Extend the ADAM CLI by `adding new commands <#commands>`__
-  Extend the ADAM CLI by `adding new commands in an external
   repository <#external-commands>`__
-  Use ADAM as a `library in new applications <#library>`__
