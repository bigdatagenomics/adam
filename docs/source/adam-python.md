# Python

ADAM python allows you to run ADAM commands in a python environment. You can run these commands in:

- pyadam: a command line interface supporting ADAM in python
- adam-notebook: a Jupyter interface supporting ADAM in a jupyter notebook


## Running an ADAM notebook Example

run ./bin/adam-notebook

In the Jupyter file directory, navigate to **scripts/examples/countKmers.ipynb**.

Here, you can run an example of counting kmers in the NA12878 sample.
