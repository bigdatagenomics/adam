A genomics processing engine and specialized file format built using [Apache Avro](http://avro.apache.org), 
[Apache Spark](http://spark.incubator.apache.org/) and [Parquet](http://parquet.io/). Apache 2 licensed.

# Introduction

Current genomic file formats are not designed for
distributed processing. ADAM addresses this by explicitly defining data
formats as [Apache Avro](http://avro.apache.org) objects and storing them in 
[Parquet](http://parquet.io) files. [Apache Spark](http://spark.incubator.apache.org/)
is used as the cluster execution system.

## Explicitly defined format

The [Sequencing Alignment Map (SAM) and Binary Alignment Map (BAM)
file specification](http://samtools.sourceforge.net/SAM1.pdf) defines a data format 
for storing reads from aligners. The specification is well-written but provides
no tools for developers to implement the format. Developers have to hand-craft 
source code to encode and decode the records which is error prone and an unneccesary
hassle.

In contrast, the [ADAM specification for storing reads]
(https://github.com/bigdatagenomics/bdg-formats/blob/master/src/main/resources/avro/bdg.avdl)
is defined in the Avro Interface Description Language (IDL) which is directly converted
into source code. Avro supports a number of computer languages. ADAM uses Java; you could 
just as easily use this Avro IDL description as the basis for a Python project. Avro
currently supports c, c++, csharp, java, javascript, php, python and ruby. 

## Ready for distributed processing

The SAM/BAM format is record-oriented with a single record for each read. However,
the typical data access pattern is column oriented, e.g. search for bases at a
specific position in a reference genome. The BAM specification tries to support
this pattern by defining a format for a separate index file. However, this index
needs to be regenerated anytime your BAM file changes which is costly. The index
does help keep the cost down on file seeks but the columnar store ADAM uses reduces
the cost of seeks even more.

Once you convert your BAM file to ADAM, it can be directly accessed by 
[Hadoop Map-Reduce](http://hadoop.apache.org), [Spark](http://spark-project.org/), 
[Shark](http://shark.cs.berkeley.edu), [Impala](https://github.com/cloudera/impala), 
[Pig](http://pig.apache.org), [Hive](http://hive.apache.org), whatever. Using
ADAM will unlock your genomic data and make it available to a broader range of
systems.

# Getting Started

## Installation

You will need to have [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) installed in order to build ADAM.

> **Note:** The default configuration is for Hadoop 2.2.0. If building against a different
> version of Hadoop, please edit the build configuration in the `<properties>` section of
> the `pom.xml` file.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/bigdatagenomics/adam.git
$ cd adam
$ export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=128m"
$ mvn clean package -DskipTests
...

```

You might want to take a peek at the `scripts/jenkins-test` script and give it a run. It will fetch a mouse chromosome, encode it to ADAM
reads and pileups, run flagstat, etc. We use this script to test that ADAM is working correctly.

## Running ADAM

ADAM is packaged via [appassembler](http://mojo.codehaus.org/appassembler/appassembler-maven-plugin/) and includes all necessary
dependencies

You might want to add the following to your `.bashrc` to make running `adam` easier:

```
alias adam-submit="${ADAM_HOME}/bin/adam-submit"
alias adam-shell="${ADAM_HOME}/bin/adam-shell"
```

`$ADAM_HOME` should be the path to where you have checked ADAM out on your local filesystem. 
The first alias should be used for running ADAM jobs that operate locally. The latter two aliases 
call scripts that wrap the `spark-submit` and `spark-shell` commands to set up ADAM. You'll need
to have the Spark binaries on your system; prebuilt binaries can be downloaded from the
[Spark website](http://spark.apache.org/downloads.html). Currently, we build for
[Spark 1.1, and Hadoop 2.3 (CDH5)](http://d3kbcqa49mib13.cloudfront.net/spark-1.1.0-bin-hadoop2.3.tgz).

Once this alias is in place, you can run adam by simply typing `adam-submit` at the commandline, e.g.

```
$ adam-submit

     e            888~-_              e                 e    e
    d8b           888   \            d8b               d8b  d8b
   /Y88b          888    |          /Y88b             d888bdY88b
  /  Y88b         888    |         /  Y88b           / Y88Y Y888b
 /____Y88b        888   /         /____Y88b         /   YY   Y888b
/      Y88b       888_-~         /      Y88b       /          Y888b

Choose one of the following commands:

           transform : Convert SAM/BAM to ADAM format and optionally perform read pre-processing transformations
            flagstat : Print statistics on reads in an ADAM file (similar to samtools flagstat)
           reads2ref : Convert an ADAM read-oriented file to an ADAM reference-oriented file
             mpileup : Output the samtool mpileup text from ADAM reference-oriented data
               print : Print an ADAM formatted file
   aggregate_pileups : Aggregate pileups in an ADAM reference-oriented file
            listdict : Print the contents of an ADAM sequence dictionary
             compare : Compare two ADAM files based on read name
    compute_variants : Compute variant data from genotypes
            bam2adam : Single-node BAM to ADAM converter (Note: the 'transform' command can take SAM or BAM as input)
            adam2vcf : Convert an ADAM variant to the VCF ADAM format
            vcf2adam : Convert a VCF file to the corresponding ADAM format

```

ADAM outputs all the commands that are available for you to run. To get
help for a specific command, run `adam-submit <command>` without any additional arguments.

````

If you followed along above, now try making your first `.adam` file like this:

````
adam-submit transform $ADAM_HOME/adam-core/src/test/resources/small.sam /tmp/small.adam
````

... and if you didn't obtain your copy of adam from github, you can [grab `small.sam` from here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigdatagenomics/adam/master/adam-core/src/test/resources/small.sam).


# flagstat

Once you have data converted to ADAM, you can gather statistics from the ADAM file using `flagstat`.
This command will output stats identically to the samtools `flagstat` command.

If you followed along above, now try gathering some statistics:

````
$ adam-submit flagstat /tmp/small.adam
20 + 0 in total (QC-passed reads + QC-failed reads)
0 + 0 primary duplicates
0 + 0 primary duplicates - both read and mate mapped
0 + 0 primary duplicates - only read mapped
0 + 0 primary duplicates - cross chromosome
0 + 0 secondary duplicates
0 + 0 secondary duplicates - both read and mate mapped
0 + 0 secondary duplicates - only read mapped
0 + 0 secondary duplicates - cross chromosome
20 + 0 mapped (100.00%:0.00%)
0 + 0 paired in sequencing
0 + 0 read1
0 + 0 read2
0 + 0 properly paired (0.00%:0.00%)
0 + 0 with itself and mate mapped
0 + 0 singletons (0.00%:0.00%)
0 + 0 with mate mapped to a different chr
0 + 0 with mate mapped to a different chr (mapQ>=5)
````

In practice, you'll find that the ADAM `flagstat` command takes orders of magnitude less
time than samtools to compute these statistics. For example, on a MacBook Pro
`flagstat NA12878_chr20.bam` took 17 seconds to run while `samtools flagstat NA12878_chr20.bam`
took 55 seconds. On larger files, the difference in speed is even more dramatic. ADAM is faster
because it's multi-threaded and distributed and uses a columnar storage format (with a
projected schema that only materializes the read flags instead of the whole read). 

# count_kmers

You can also use ADAM to count all K-mers present across all reads in the
`.adam` file using `count_kmers`.  Try this:

````
$ adam-submit count_kmers /tmp/small.adam /tmp/kmers.adam 10
$ head /tmp/kmers.adam/part-*
TTTTAAGGTT, 1
TTCCGATTTT, 1
GAGCAGCCTT, 1
CCTGCTGTAT, 1
AATTGGCACT, 1
GGCCAGGACT, 1
GCAGTCCCTC, 1
AACTTTGAAT, 1
GATGACGTGG, 1
CTGTCCCTGT, 1
````

Each line contains part-* file(s) with line-based records that contain two
comma-delimited values.  The first value is the K-mer itself and the second
value is the number of times that K-mer occurred in the input file.  

# Running on a cluster

We provide the `adam-submit` and `adam-shell` commands under the `bin` directory. These can
be used to submit ADAM jobs to a spark cluster, or to run ADAM interactively.

## Running Plugins

ADAM allows users to create plugins via the [ADAMPlugin](https://github.com/bigdatagenomics/adam/blob/master/adam-core/src/main/scala/org/bdgenomics/adam/plugins/ADAMPlugin.scala)
trait. These plugins are then imported using the Java classpath at runtime. To add to the classpath when
using appassembler, use the `$CLASSPATH_PREFIX` environment variable. For an example of how to use
the plugin interface, please see the [adam-plugins repo](https://github.com/heuermh/adam-plugins).
