## Why ADAM?

Over the last decade, DNA and RNA sequencing has evolved from an expensive, labor intensive method to a cheap commodity. The consequence of this is generation of _massive amounts of genomic and transcriptomic data_. Typically, tools to process and interpret these data are developed at academic labs, with a focus on excellence of the results generated, not on __scalability__ and __interoperability__. A typical _sequencing pipeline_ consists of a string of tools going from quality control, mapping, mapped read preprocessing, to variant calling or quantification, depending on the application at hand. Concretely, this usually means that such a pipeline is a string of tools, glued together by scripts or workflow engines, with data written to files in each step.
This approach entails three main bottlenecks: 

  1. __scaling the pipeline__ comes down to scaling each of the individual tools, 
  2. the __stability of the pipeline__ heavily depends on the consistency of the intermediate file formats, and 
  3. __writing to and reading__ from disk is a major slow-down.

We propose here a transformative solution for these problems, by replacing ad-hoc pipelines by the [ADAM framework](http://bdgenomics.org/), developed in the [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) ecosystem.
ADAM provides specialized file formats for the standard data structures used in genomics analysis: _mapped reads_ (typically stored as `.bam` files), _representation of genomic regions_ (`.bed` files), and _variants_ (`.vcf` files), using [Avro](https://avro.apache.org/) and [Parquet](http://parquet.apache.org/). This allows to use the in-memory cluster computing functionality of Apache Spark, ensuring efficient and fault-tolerant distribution based on data parallelism, without the intermediate disk operations required in classical distributed approaches.

Furthermore, the ADAM-Spark approach comes with an additional benefit. Typically, the endpoint of a sequencing pipeline is a file with processed data for a single sample: e.g. variants for DNA sequencing, read counts for RNA sequencing, etc. The real endpoint. however, of a sequencing experiment initiated by an investigator is 
__interpretation__ of these data in a certain context. This usually translates into (statistical) analysis of multiple samples, connection with (clinical) metadata, interactive visualization, using data science tools such as R, Python, Tableau and Spotfire. In addition to scalable distributed processing, Spark also allows such __interactive data analysis__ in the form of analysis notebooks (Spark Notebook or Zeppelin), or direct connection to the data in R and Python.

## Hello World: Counting K-mers

Here's an example ADAM CLI command that will count 10-mers in [a test `.sam` file that lives in this repository](https://github.com/bigdatagenomics/adam/blob/master/adam-core/src/test/resources/small.sam):

```bash
$ adam-submit count_kmers /tmp/small.adam /tmp/kmers.adam 10
$ head /tmp/kmers.adam/part-*
(AATTGGCACT,1)
(TTCCGATTTT,1)
(GAGCAGCCTT,1)
(CCTGCTGTAT,1)
(TTTTAAGGTT,1)
(GGCCAGGACT,1)
(GCAGTCCCTC,1)
(AACTTTGAAT,1)
(GATGACGTGG,1)
(CTGTCCCTGT,1)
```

## More than K-mer Counting

ADAM does much more than just k-mer counting. Running the ADAM CLI without arguments or with `--help` will display available commands, e.g.

```
$ adam-submit

       e         888~-_          e             e    e
      d8b        888   \        d8b           d8b  d8b
     /Y88b       888    |      /Y88b         d888bdY88b
    /  Y88b      888    |     /  Y88b       / Y88Y Y888b
   /____Y88b     888   /     /____Y88b     /   YY   Y888b
  /      Y88b    888_-~     /      Y88b   /          Y888b

The ADAM `transform` command allows you to mark duplicates, run base quality score recalibration (BQSR) and other pre-processing steps on your data.

# Getting Started

## Installation

### Binary Distributions

Bundled release binaries can be found on our [releases][] page.

### Building from Source

You will need to have [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) installed in order to build ADAM.

> **Note:** The default configuration is for Hadoop 2.6.0. If building against a different
> version of Hadoop, please edit the build configuration in the `<properties>` section of
> the `pom.xml` file.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/bigdatagenomics/adam.git
$ cd adam
$ export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m"
$ mvn clean package -DskipTests
...
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Total time: 9.647s
[INFO] Finished at: Thu May 23 15:50:42 PDT 2013
[INFO] Final Memory: 19M/81M
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

You might want to take a peek at the `scripts/jenkins-test` script and give it a run. It will fetch a mouse chromosome, encode it to ADAM
reads and pileups, run flagstat, etc. We use this script to test that ADAM is working correctly.

### Installing Spark

You'll need to have a Spark release on your system and the `$SPARK_HOME` environment variable pointing at it; prebuilt binaries can be downloaded from the
[Spark website](http://spark.apache.org/downloads.html). Currently, our continuous builds default to
[Spark 1.6.1 built against Hadoop 2.6](http://d3kbcqa49mib13.cloudfront.net/spark-1.6.1-bin-hadoop2.6.tgz), but any more recent Spark distribution should also work.

### Helpful Aliases

You might want to add the following to your `.bashrc` to make running ADAM easier:

```
alias adam-submit="${ADAM_HOME}/bin/adam-submit"
alias adam-shell="${ADAM_HOME}/bin/adam-shell"
```

`$ADAM_HOME` should be the path to a [binary release][releases] or a clone of this repository on your local filesystem. 

These aliases call scripts that wrap the `spark-submit` and `spark-shell` commands to set up ADAM.Once they are in place, you can run adam by simply typing `adam-submit` at the command line, [as demonstrated above](./README.md#more-than-k-mer-counting).

## Running ADAM

Now you can try running some simple ADAM commands:

### `transform`
Make your first `.adam` file like this:

````
adam-submit transform $ADAM_HOME/adam-core/src/test/resources/small.sam /tmp/small.adam
````

If you didn't obtain your copy of adam from github, you can [grab `small.sam` here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigdatagenomics/adam/master/adam-core/src/test/resources/small.sam).


### `flagstat`

Once you have data converted to ADAM, you can gather statistics from the ADAM file using `flagstat`.
This command will output stats identically to the samtools `flagstat` command.

If you followed along above, now try gathering some statistics:

````
$ adam-submit flagstat /tmp/small.adam
20 + 0 in total (QC-passed reads + QC-failed reads)
0 + 0 primary duplicates
0 + 0 primary duplicates - both read and mate mapped
0 + 0 primary duplicates - only read mapped
0 + 0 primary duplicates - cross chromosome
0 + 0 secondary duplicates
0 + 0 secondary duplicates - both read and mate mapped
0 + 0 secondary duplicates - only read mapped
0 + 0 secondary duplicates - cross chromosome
20 + 0 mapped (100.00%:0.00%)
0 + 0 paired in sequencing
0 + 0 read1
0 + 0 read2
0 + 0 properly paired (0.00%:0.00%)
0 + 0 with itself and mate mapped
0 + 0 singletons (0.00%:0.00%)
0 + 0 with mate mapped to a different chr
0 + 0 with mate mapped to a different chr (mapQ>=5)
````

In practice, you'll find that the ADAM `flagstat` command takes orders of magnitude less
time than samtools to compute these statistics. For example, on a MacBook Pro
`flagstat NA12878_chr20.bam` took 17 seconds to run while `samtools flagstat NA12878_chr20.bam`
took 55 seconds. On larger files, the difference in speed is even more dramatic. ADAM is faster
because it's multi-threaded and distributed and uses a columnar storage format (with a
projected schema that only materializes the read flags instead of the whole read). 

### `adam-shell`

The `adam-shell` command opens an interpreter that you can run ad-hoc ADAM commands in.

For example, the following code snippet will generate a result similar to [the k-mer-counting example above](./README.md#hello-world-counting-k-mers), but with the k-mers sorted in descending order of their number of occurrences. To use this, save the code snippet as `kmer.scala` and run `adam-shell -i kmer.scala`.

`kmer.scala`
```scala
import org.bdgenomics.adam.rdd.ADAMContext._
import org.bdgenomics.adam.projections.{ AlignmentRecordField, Projection }

// Load alignments from disk
val reads = sc.loadAlignments(
  "/data/NA21144.chrom11.ILLUMINA.adam",
  projection = Some(
    Projection(
      AlignmentRecordField.sequence,
      AlignmentRecordField.readMapped,
      AlignmentRecordField.mapq
    )
  )
)

// Generate, count and sort 21-mers
val kmers =
  reads
    .rdd
    .flatMap(_.getSequence.sliding(21).map(k => (k, 1L)))
    .reduceByKey(_ + _)
    .map(_.swap)
    .sortByKey(ascending = false)

// Print the top 10 most common 21-mers
kmers.take(10).foreach(println)
```
`adam-shell -i kmer.scala`
```
$ adam-shell -i kmer.scala

# Running on a cluster

The `adam-submit` and `adam-shell` commands can also
be used to submit ADAM jobs to a Spark cluster, or to run ADAM interactively. Cluster mode can be enabled by passing [the same flags you'd pass to Spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.5.2/submitting-applications.html#launching-applications-with-spark-submit), e.g. `--master yarn --deploy-mode client`.

# Under the Hood
ADAM relies on several open-source technologies to make genomic analyses fast and massively parallelizableâ€¦

## Apache Spark

[Apache Spark][Spark] allows developers to write algorithms in succinct code that can run fast locally, on an in-house cluster or on Amazon, Google or Microsoft clouds. 

## Apache Parquet

[Apache Parquet][Parquet] is a columnar storage format available to any project in the Hadoop ecosystem, regardless of the choice of data processing framework, data model or programming language.

- Parquet compresses legacy genomic formats using standard columnar techniques (e.g. RLE, dictionary encoding). ADAM files are typically ~20% smaller than compressed BAM files.
- Parquet integrates with:
    - **Query engines**: Hive, Impala, HAWQ, IBM Big SQL, Drill, Tajo, Pig, Presto
    - **Frameworks**: Spark, MapReduce, Cascading, Crunch, Scalding, Kite
    - **Data models**: Avro, Thrift, ProtocolBuffers, POJOs
- Parquet is simply a file format which makes it easy to sync and share data using tools like `distcp`, `rsync`, etc
- Parquet provides a command-line tool, `parquet.hadoop.PrintFooter`, which reports useful compression statistics 

In the counting k-mers example above, you can see there is a defined *predicate* and *projection*. The *predicate* allows rapid filtering of rows while a *projection* allows you to efficiently materialize only specific columns for analysis. For this k-mer counting example, we filter out any records that are not mapped or have a `MAPQ` less than 20 using a `predicate` and only materialize the `Sequence`, `ReadMapped` flag and `MAPQ` columns and skip over all other fields like `Reference` or `Start` position, e.g.

Sequence| ReadMapped | MAPQ | ~~Reference~~ | ~~Start~~ | ...
--------|------------|------|-----------|-------|-------
~~GGTCCAT~~ | ~~false~~ | - | ~~chrom1~~ | - | ...
TACTGAA | true | 30 | ~~chrom1~~ | ~~34232~~ | ...
~~TTGAATG~~ | ~~true~~ | ~~17~~ | ~~chrom1~~ | ~~309403~~ | ...

## Apache Avro

- [Apache Avro][Avro] is a data serialization system.
- All Big Data Genomics schemas are published at [https://github.com/bigdatagenomics/bdg-formats](https://github.com/bigdatagenomics/bdg-formats).
- Having explicit schemas and self-describing data makes integrating, sharing and evolving formats easier.

Our Avro schemas are directly converted into source code using Avro tools. Avro supports a number of computer languages. ADAM uses Java; you could 
just as easily use this Avro IDL description as the basis for a Python project. Avro currently supports c, c++, csharp, java, javascript, php, python and ruby. 

# Downstream Applications

There are a number of projects built on ADAM, e.g.

- [RNAdam](https://github.com/bigdatagenomics/rice) provides an RNA pipeline on top of ADAM with isoform quantification and fusion transcription detection
- [Avocado](https://github.com/bigdatagenomics/avocado) is a variant caller built on top of ADAM for germline and somatic calling
- [PacMin](https://github.com/bigdatagenomics/PacMin) is an assembler for PacBio reads
